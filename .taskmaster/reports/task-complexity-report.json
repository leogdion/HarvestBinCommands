		{
			"taskId": 1,
			"taskTitle": "Initialize Swift Package Structure",
			"complexityScore": 4,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 5,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down the Swift package initialization into subtasks for creating Package.swift, configuring each target (Core, Defaults, Commands, Demo), setting up the swift-subprocess dependency, creating the directory structure, and verifying the build configuration",
			"reasoning": "While package initialization is straightforward, it requires careful setup of multiple targets with correct dependencies and directory structure. The swift-subprocess integration adds slight complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 2,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Core Command Infrastructure",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for implementing CommandProtocol, CommandExecutor with subprocess integration, CommandResult structure, error handling system, output parsing utilities, sudo privilege escalation, process killing functionality, and comprehensive unit tests with mocking",
			"reasoning": "This is the foundation of the entire system requiring robust async/await implementation, subprocess management, error handling, and security considerations for sudo operations. The actor-based CommandExecutor adds concurrency complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 3,
			"taskTitle": "Build Defaults Type System",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into implementing DefaultsValue protocol, type conformances for Bool/String/Int/Float, complex type support for Array/Dictionary, DefaultsDomain structure with known domains, DefaultsKey system, type conversion error handling, and comprehensive unit tests for all types",
			"reasoning": "Type-safe value handling requires implementing protocol conformances for multiple types including complex collections. The parsing logic for different output formats and error handling for type mismatches adds significant complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 4,
			"taskTitle": "Create Defaults Reader and Writer",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for implementing DefaultsReader with generic and convenience methods, DefaultsWriter with type-safe writing, command creation for read/write operations, domain-specific extensions, error handling for missing keys, and integration tests",
			"reasoning": "Requires implementing both generic and convenience APIs, proper async/await integration with CommandExecutor, and careful error handling. The hybrid API design adds design complexity."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 5,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Dock Commands",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into implementing icon size configuration, position settings, auto-hide functionality, minimize effects, show recents and static-only modes, and ensuring proper Dock restart triggers for all commands",
			"reasoning": "While individual commands are straightforward, there are multiple settings to implement with proper validation, enum handling, and ensuring Dock restart triggers. The variety of settings increases scope."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 6,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Finder and System Commands",
			"complexityScore": 5,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 7,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for Finder hidden files, file extensions, path bar, status bar, view styles, system transparency settings, and desktop icon visibility with proper process restart handling",
			"reasoning": "Similar complexity to Dock commands but spans two different command categories. Requires handling both Finder and system-wide settings with different domains and process restart requirements."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 7,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Screenshot, Safari, and Input Commands",
			"complexityScore": 6,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into screenshot location/format/shadow settings, Safari developer/debug menus, mouse tracking speed, natural scrolling, key repeat settings, proper validation for paths and numeric ranges, and process restart handling",
			"reasoning": "Covers three distinct command categories with different validation requirements. Screenshot commands need path validation, input commands need numeric range validation, and different processes need restarting."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 8,
			"taskTitle": "Implement Administrative Commands",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 6,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for SSH key generation with validation, auto-login configuration, Dock clearing, remote access control, sudo authorization handling, and comprehensive safety validations for dangerous operations",
			"reasoning": "Administrative commands require careful security considerations, proper sudo handling, and safety validations. SSH key generation and system configuration changes are sensitive operations requiring robust error handling."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 9,
			"taskTitle": "Build SwiftUI Demo Application",
			"complexityScore": 8,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 10,
			"expansionPrompt": "Break down into creating CommandManager, category sidebar, command list with search, parameter input components for different types, output console, progress indicators, sudo authorization UI, risk level indicators, keyboard navigation, and comprehensive UI testing",
			"reasoning": "Full SwiftUI application with complex state management, dynamic parameter inputs based on command types, search/filtering, async command execution, and proper error display. Requires significant UI/UX work."
		},
		{
			"taskId": 10,
			"taskTitle": "Complete Testing, Documentation, and Polish",
			"complexityScore": 7,
			"recommendedSubtasks": 8,
			"expansionPrompt": "Create subtasks for unit test suite with 80%+ coverage, integration tests, API documentation with DocC, README with examples, security audit for sudo commands, performance optimization, SwiftLint integration, and release preparation with CI/CD",
			"reasoning": "Comprehensive testing and documentation requires significant effort across multiple areas. Includes unit tests, integration tests, documentation, performance optimization, and release engineering tasks."
